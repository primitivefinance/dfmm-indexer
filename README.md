# Network Participation Index (NPI)

This project contains a practical implementaion of Primitive's Network Participation Index, a method for quantifying participation in the ETHSP product launch.


### WARNING: This indexer does not currently implement `dfmm-indexer` functionality, and is not yet a generic solution. The schema is extendable in this manner.
